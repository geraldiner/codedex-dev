# Gen AI 101

## Gen AI

### What is Gen AI?

- Generative Artificial Intelligence
- Creates new content based on prompts and large language models (LLMs)

### How does AI work?

- LLMs are trained using natural language processing (NLP) techniques
- NLP is a branch of machine learning that teaches computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language
  - examples: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
- LLMs use patterns, sequences, and datasets to generate text, translate languages, and answer questions

#### AI branches visual?

- Machine Learning
  - Natural Language Processing
    - Large Language Models
      - Gen AI

## Language Models

### How do LLMs understand and generate human language?

- Sequences - trained on datasets to recognize sequences, eg. predicting the next letter or word, filling in blanks (Wheel of Fortune)
- NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit) - python library for text generation, spell check, translation

## Tokens

### How are tokens used to train LLMs?

- Tokens: Small units of data used to train gen AI models. could be whole words, subwords, or other content.
  - smallest units of meaning => structure and semantics of text
- Tokenization: Process of making raw data trainable for language models. may include splitting text into individual words.

## N-grams

### How are n-grams used to train LLMs?

- N-grams: sequences of 'n' tokens from a given sample of text. used as patterns to help language models make predictions. analyze sequences to understand how words are commonly used together.
  - analyze the probability of certain word sequences based on their occurrence in a large dataset

### What are the 3 popular models of n-grams?

- Unigram - single character or word
- Bigram - 2 consecutive characters or words
- Trigram - 3 consecutive characters or words

### How can you create n-grams?

- Use the nltk python library to first tokenize a string, and then generate ngrams from the tokens

## Text Classification

### What is Text Classification?

- categorizing text into different groups
- Gen AI models use a Naive Bayes classifier
  - Naive Bayes classifier is based on a basic probability rule called Bayes' Theorem and assumes that all features are independent of each other. Works well for identifying spam emails, analyzing sentiment, and classifying documents
  - ❓ What is Bayes' Theorem?

### How can you implement the Naive Bayes classifier?

- Use the scikit-learn library, which provides tools for text vectorization, model training, and evaluation

### What classes and functions are crucial for text classification?

- CountVectorizer: converts text data into a numerical format that the LLM can understand. counts how many times each word appears in the text
- MultinomialNB: Naive Bayes classifier which is used to train the model on numerical text data
- train_test_split: helps split dataset into training and testing sets. commonly used in predictive machine learning
- accuracy_score: provides a way to measure the accuracy of the model by comparing predicted labels with actual labels in the test set
